Before diving into details I believe the name deserves some clarification:
[Corzuela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_brocket) stands for the
red brockets living in the area. Nowdays is hard to divise them but with
a bit of luck you will be able to see one.

With this in mind, a possible traduction of the name could be
"The Jump of the Red Brocket".

The official name of the area is "Cascada de la Cola Sur", because
its located at the south of the park.
